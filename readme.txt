# Step1: Create new spreadsheet on your google spreadsheet.
# Step2: Edit your spreadsheet, such like column title... and so on.
# Step3: Click Tool -> Script Editor -> Paste the javascript code (GoogleSpreadsheet.js)
# Step4: Go to the pushingbox to create new account. We need to use pushingbox as a middle connector between Arduino and Google.
# Step5: Adjust your pushingbox configuration.
# Step6: Edit your Arduino code. (PS. Please use the Static IP, DHCP can't assign a ip to internet.)
